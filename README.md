# TF2 Demo Player
This is an application for managing and playing back TF2 demos.

![](images/ss1.png)

## Features
+ Listing demos with their properties (name, map, length,...)
+ Managing Bookmarks made with the in-game demo tools
+ Integration with rcon to:
    + Play back the selected demo in-game
    + Skip to timestamp/bookmark
+ Add descriptions/notes to demos
+ Convert demos to replays with acurrate metadata
+ Parse demos and display players, chat messages, kills, votes and some other stuff.

## Usage
To be able to use the playback functions of the app TF2 needs to be configured to enable client rcon.
To do this you need to add `-usercon` to your launch parameters on steam and add this to your autoexec.cfg:

```
ip 0.0.0.0
rcon_password <password>
net_start
```
Then put the same password in the settings and test the connection with the button there. If it says "Connection successful" you're good to go.

## Building
To build this app you first need to install rust and the GTK4 development libraries as described [here](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk4-rs/stable/latest/book/installation.html).

Once the required libraries are installed, building should be as easy as typing 
```
cargo build
```
in the project root.

On windows the easiest way to build it is using MSYS2, by installing the mingw versions of gtk4 and libadwaita there and then running `package_win.sh` within it. This produces a "pack" folder that contains all the files needed for the program to run outside of msys.

## License
This repo is MIT licensed, but bundles a vendored copy of [demo-analysis](https://github.com/Nocrex/demo-analysis) (see `demo-analysis/`) for cheat-detection algorithms. demo-analysis is GPLv3-licensed, and since it's compiled directly into the `tf2-demo-player` binary, distributed builds of this program are a combined work and must comply with GPLv3 (in addition to this repo's own MIT terms) as a whole.
